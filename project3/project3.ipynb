    "Humans are born with two kidneys, but can live well with just one healthy kidney. Hence, there is an opportunity for a live donor to donate a kidney to a patient whose kidneys have failed. \n",

    "### Modeling Kidney Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a kidney exchange is to enable patients in need of a kidney who have someone willing to donate to them, but whose kidney is incompatible, find a chain of donor-recipients that enable the patient to receive a compatible kidney from another donor in exchange for this patient's willing donor donating a kidney to another patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to organize the market in the following way. Each recipient, $R_i$, is paired with their incompatible but willing donor, $D_i$. A market of size $N$ will have $N$ incompatible pairs {$(R_1, D_1), ..., (R_n, D_n)$}. A donor will donate her kidney if and only if her paired but incompatible recipient also receives a kidney. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can model the market is a directed graph where each edge connects a donor with a compatible recipient. Thus, the edges represent all directly compatible exchanges. The problem the market designer faces is finding a method that will maximize the survival rate while accounting for the constraints on donations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Donation is usually done through _k_-way exchanges, which can be represented as cycles in the directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _two-way exchange_ is when a donor, $D_i$, donates to a recipient, $R_j$, whose incompatible partner $D_j$ then donates to $R_i$. For this exchange to work, $D_i$ must be compatible with $R_j$ and $D_j$ must be compatible with $R_i$. There are a total of two incompatible pairs, two donors and two recipients, in a two-way exchange. In a _three-way exchange_, the donor in pair 1 donates to pair 2, whose donor donates to pair 3, whose donor donates to pair 1. A _k-way exchange_ would have $k$ pairs donating in a cycle of length $k$.\n",

You may be it useful to predict the likelihood that a useful donor kidney arrives in the next time period by estimating the probability a random kidney is compatible."
