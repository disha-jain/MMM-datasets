    "As part of this project, you will participate in a sponsored search auction, much like the one Google uses to select the ads it displays during a query. You will design and implement a bidding algorithm where the goal is to maximize the number of clicks you can obtain in a series of generalized second price auctions, competing with other teams in the class. Each team will be given a budget of $10,000 (imaginary dollars, of course!). Although there will be a bonus for doing well in the final auction, this will not be the primary factor in grading this assignment. We are more interested in how you understand the theory and develop your algorithm.\n",

You may continue to work with the same people you have worked on for previous projects, but are encouraged to consider whether it would be more beneficial to gain experience working with others by switching your team."

    "Like Google's ad words auctions, we will use a _generalized second price auction_ where you will be bidding for an ad position on a web page. \n",

    "- Hal Varian. [_Position Auctions_](//uvammm.github.io/docs/position.pdf). International Journal of Industrial Organization 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each auction there will be three advertisement slots available, with slot 1 being at the top, slot 2 being below 1, and 3 below 2. These correspond to the most desirable placements on the generated page. For the same ad and user population, slot 1 has a click rate of 6%, slot 2 has a click rate of 3%, and slot 3 has a click rate of 1%. Slots are sold in a _pay-per-click_ fashion where a bidder pays for a slot only if their ad is clicked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each auction proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Participants submit their bids.\n",
    "2. A user arrives and submits a search query.\n",
    "3. The bids are ranked by magnitude with the top three bids that exceed the reserve price (25 cents) getting the three available slots.\n",
    "4. The highest bidder out of those three receives the first slot, the second highest bidder receives slot 2, and the third highest bidder receives slot 3.\n",
    "5. A bidder pays only if their ad is clicked and the payment rules are as follows:\n",
    "    * Bidder 1 pays a price equal to bid 2\n",
    "    * Bidder 2 pays a price equal to bid 3\n",
    "    * Bidder 3 pays a price equal to bid 4 or the reserve price, whichever is higher\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice that a winning bidder only pays when their ad gets clicked, and we assume that at most one ad will be clicked per user search query. After the auction takes place, the bidder is notified if the user clicked on your ad or not. If the bidder's ad received a click, the message returned to you will tell you the slot you were in and the price you paid, relayed as (slot, price). The message \"user did not click on your ad\" will be returned if you won the auction but received no click or if you lost the auction. Therefore, you should be thinking about optimization strategies that fit into this limited information framework. \n"

For example, there is no dominant strategy if there are two spots with click-through rates (CTR) of 200 per month and 199 month and three Advertisers with value per click of 10 USD, 4 USD, and 2 USD respectively. If Advertiser 1 bids 3 USD when his true value is 10 USD, he will win the second position and his payoff is (10-2)199=1592. But if he bids truthfully, he wins the first position and his payoff is (10-4)200=1200.

The feedback from the auctioneer includes the average winning bid prices for the past 10 bids for each slot (1,2, & 3) and whether or not our advertisement was clicked. The feedback an auctioneer provides should inform a player’s next bid in an auction. If our bid is below the average winning bid of slot 3, then we should raise our bid prices for the next auction by half of our true willingness to pay for a bid. If our bid won only slot 3, then it is in our best strategy to swap spots with the winner of slot 2. In this case, we would bid our true value or the average winning bid price for slot 2, whichever is lower. Overtime, bid would evolve to their true prices.

    "\n",
    "In the real world of online advertising, consumers are heterogeneous in their preferences for products. Platforms that auction off ad slots may also aggregate information on consumers and provide that information to potential advertisers so that they can target individual agents. Advertisers now compete for consumer demand (price competition) as well as for a slot in the auction. Policies of information disclosure and consumer privacy change how advertisers bid and price their products.\n",

    "Intuitively, if we are able to target consumers, our bid price structures would be arbitrary as long as we win a slot. This is because targeted consumers will be able to view all three advertisements regardless of the slot position. According to the research by Corniere and de Nijis, “the disclosure of information by the platform induces a shift in the demand function, which leads to an increase in the equilibrium price of goods.” In other words, they argue that because advertisers can target customers, they bid higher prices resulting in higher profits for publishers. These profits are also captured by bidders as click through rates are higher and advertisers are able to sell more goods to their targeted customers. "
